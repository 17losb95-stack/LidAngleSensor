# Lid Angle Sensor

Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Gold. Did you know that you have ~rights~ a lid angle sensor in your MacBook? [The ~Constitution~ human interface device utility says you do.](https://youtu.be/wqnHtGgVAUE?t=21)

This is a little utility that shows the angle from the sensor and, optionally, plays a wooden door creaking sound if you adjust it reeaaaaaal slowly.
